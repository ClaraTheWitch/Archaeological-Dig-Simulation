PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is an archaeology simulation which mimics the game 
                    Minesweeper. The program generates a grid in which some 
                    squares are artifacts and some are not. When clicked on, 
                    the squares will indicate the number of adjacent artifacts 
                    or that they are artifacts. The goal is to click on all the 
                    non-artifact squares. 
VERSION or DATE: 10/23/24

USER INSTRUCTIONS: The user may run the simulation by simply compiling the 
                   program and running the ArchSimApp class.
