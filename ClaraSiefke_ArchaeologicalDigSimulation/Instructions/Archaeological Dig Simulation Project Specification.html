  <h1>Final Project:<br>
    Archaeological Dig Simulation</h1>
</div>

<p>
</p><hr width="100%">

<p>In this project you will design and implement a modified version of an 
Archaeological Dig Simulation that behaves a lot like the solitaire computer game
MineSweeper.</p>
<h3>Problem Specification:</h3>
<p>Design a program to simulate an archaeological
dig. The goal is to dig near ancient artifacts buried in the soil
to loosen them and make it easy for the archaeologists to
extract them manually.  If you dig too close to the artifacts, though, you will
damage them.
The archaeologists have mapped out the dig site as a grid.
The chemistry department has come up with a soil test to see whether there 
are artifacts close by, either in the current grid location or in an adjacent
location.
Your job is to dig in the grid blocks
without artifacts and to leave the blocks with artifacts alone.  Since
this is such an important project, the archaeological team wants their
students to be able to practice this before they get to the dig.  You
are going to write the simulation that the students can use to
practice.</p>
<p>
</p><h3>Program Specification:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>  The simulation consists of a square grid representing the dig site.&nbsp; The
    grid contains artifacts in various locations, and the number and location
    of the artifacts should change every time the simulation is run.
   &nbsp; In particular, there
should be no fewer than 5 artifacts and no more than about 10% of 
the number of cells in the grid.  Each artifact should be placed at a
random location in the grid and no two artifacts should be placed at the
same place.
  </li><li>When the simulation starts the grid appears
    empty, representing the site before any digging has taken place.
    All blocks should be "invisible"; that
    is, they should not indicate whether they contain an artifact, are
    adjacent to one or more artifacts, or are nowhere near any artifacts.
  </li><li>Clicking on a grid block represents digging in that location.
  When a user clicks on one of the blocks in the grid they are given feedback
  depending on the contents of the block and its neighbors.  In particular,
    <ul>
  <li>If the block contains an artifact, 
  the display should show the artifact that has been exposed
  and damaged.&nbsp; This could be done as simply as displaying an "A" for artifact
  in the grid cell, or by displaying a picture of an artifact. Damaging an artifact
  ends the simulation.
  </li><li>If the block does not contain an artifact but is adjacent to one
  or more blocks that do contain artifacts, the block should display
  the number of artifacts adjacent to that block.
  </li><li>If the block does not contain an artifact and the block is not
  adjacent to any artifacts, the block should indicate that the block is empty.
The user should be able to visually distinguish between a block where they have
    dug and found nothing and a block where they have not yet dug; for example,
    you might display a dash or some other character in blocks where users has
    dug and found nothing.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>The user continues to click on blocks until they click on an
  artifact, ending the simulation, or until they have clicked on all the
    blocks not containing artifacts, successfully completing the dig.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><h3>Classes to Get Started:</h3>
<p>Since we have not yet talked in class about how to develop graphical user
  interfaces, we are providing two classes,
  <code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimGUI.java">ArchSimGUI</a></code>
  and <code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimDisplay.java">ArchSimDisplay</a></code>.&nbsp; The
  user interface responds to certain user actions, such as pressing the Restart
  button or clicking the mouse within a cell in the grid, but it does not know
  what actions to perform when these events occur.&nbsp; It requires a class
  with which it can interact that does know what actions to perform.&nbsp; Therefore,
  we have created an interface, <a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimulation.java"><code>ArchSimulation</code></a>,
  that specifies a set of methods that the GUI can invoke.&nbsp; The display
  class also has some special requirements; it assumes that the objects in the
  grid are not just normal <code>GridObject</code> instances, but that they
  are instances of a class that has an <code>isVisible</code> method so that
  the display can tell which objects in the display it should show and which
  should remain hidden.&nbsp; We have provided a skeleton  <a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimGridBlock.java"><code>ArchSimGridBlock</code></a> class
  that has such a method as well as a method that indicates whether the
  object is an artifact (each method has stub functionality).
  Finally, to make
  it easier for you to get started and to test your program at every step of
  the way, we have provided two classes, 
  <a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimApp.java"><code>ArchSimApp</code></a> and
   <a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/DummyArchSimulation.java"><code>DummyArchSimulation</code></a>,
  that will allow you to compile and "run" the other classes we have
  provided.</p>
<p>In summary, the files being provided to you are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimApp.java">ArchSimApp</a></code> -
    the main  application that starts the graphical user interface</li>
  <li><code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimGUI.java">ArchSimGUI.java</a></code> and
  <code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimDisplay.java">ArchSimDisplay.java</a></code> -
  the class that implement a graphical user interface for the archaeology dig
  simulation and the class that displays the grid within that user interface</li>
  <li><code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimulation.java">ArchSimulation</a></code> -
    the interface that specifies the set of methods that the GUI invokes in responding
    to user events</li>
  <li><code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/DummyArchSimulation.java">DummyArchSimulation</a></code> -
    a trivial class that provides empty implementations for the methods specified
    by the <code>ArchSimulation</code> interface; you should leave this
    class as it is and create a new class that implements the
    <code>ArchSimulation</code> interface</li>
  <li><code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/JavaSourceFiles/ArchSimGridBlock.java">ArchSimGridBlock</a></code> -
    an extension of <code>GridObject</code> that provides an <code>isVisible</code> method
    (actually, this class extends <code>TextCell</code>, so you can use it to
    put simple strings in the grid); you could add functionality to this class
    or create subclasses that have the functionality you want</li>
  <li>
    <code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/grid.jar">grid.jar</a></code>
    - the Java archive library for the Grid Package, containing classes
    such as
    <code>BoundedGrid</code>, <code>GridObject</code>, <code>TextCell</code>,
    <i>etc</i>.
    <a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/GridPkgDocs/" target="_blank">Class documentation for all classes in the Grid
        Package</a> can be found
    <a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/GridPkgDocs/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><h3>Suggestions for Proceeding:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first thing you should do is to become familiar with the classes we have
  provided, particularly the <code>ArchSimulation</code> interface and  <code>ArchSimGridBlock</code> classes.<br>
</li><li>Next, you should develop a  design for your simulation program that shows
  the existing classes and any additional classes you think you will need, what
  operations they should have, and how you expect them to interact. For example,
  you
may wish to have  different classes that represent the different types
of blocks in the simulation, with shared behavior in a shared superclass.
 
(In order to come up with an appropriate design, you should thoroughly
understand the problem specification, so make sure you read the rest of
the assignment before continuing with your design.)<br>
</li><li>You may wish to begin by placing the artifacts in your grid.
   Remember that there
should be no fewer than 5 artifacts and no more than about 10% of 
the number of cells in the grid.  Each artifact should be placed at a
random location in the grid and no two artifacts should be placed at the
same place.  Run the program to test it.&nbsp; For testing purposes, you may
want to have all your
artifact blocks visible when first constructed, so that you can see
where your program is putting them.
<br>
</li><li>For each grid location that does not contain an artifact, you should
count up the number of adjacent artifacts (in other words, the number of
adjacent blocks that contain an artifact).  Note that the grid object that the
  <code>ArchSimGUI</code> class passes to an <code>ArchSimulation</code> class
  considers all <i>eight</i> adjacent
  locations around a grid cell (including the ones on diagonals)
to be its neighbors.
Thus, the number of adjacent artifacts may range from 0 to 8.&nbsp; You may wish
to put objects representing (and displaying) the neighboring artifact count in
the grid at the very beginning, before the simulation starts, or you may wish
to insert them as the user clicks on the corresponding cells.&nbsp; Grid cells
that have no adjacent artifacts should be visually distinctive from those that
have adjacent artifacts.&nbsp; Test
your
program so far. (Again, you probably want all objects in the grid to be
visible for this testing.)<br>
</li><li>Once you can place and display artifacts and can display locations that have
  been found to be empty (with artifact counts if there are artifacts adjacent
  to an empty location), then you can modify your program so that the grid appears
  to be empty when the simulation starts (any objects in it at the start are
  invisible) and the contents of the various grid
  blocks are made visible only when the user clicks on the corresponding cell.&nbsp; Test
  your
modified program.<br>
</li><li>Modify your program to indicate that an unsuccessful grid simulation when
  the user clicks on (digs up and damages) an artifact.&nbsp; Test your program.&nbsp; If
  you have done this correctly, the graphical user interface should change the
  background color of the grid and change the window title to be an error message
  when the user clicks on a hidden artifact.<br>
</li><li>Enhance your program to recognize a successfully completed dig. If
  you have done this correctly, the graphical user interface should change the
  background color of the grid and change the window title to be a congratulatory
  message when all dig site locations that do not contain artifacts have been
  explored.<br>
</li><li>As you go, you should create javadoc documentation for your new classes and
  methods, and should use comments inside your methods for internal documentation.&nbsp; When
  you are finished with your project, you should create user documentation for
  your program that is accessible from the "Help" menu. To
  do this, you will need to edit the <code>ArchSimApp</code> class, which creates
  the
  "Help" menu.&nbsp; Provide the appropriate information for the 
  author(s), assistance, and date.&nbsp; Then create a document called 
  <code>ArchDigHelp.html</code> that contains information for users about what
  the program is, how it works, what it	does, etc.&nbsp; Save this file in the same folder as the <code>.project</code>
  file.&nbsp; Run the program and test both menu items in the "Help" menu.<br>
</li><li>You may use any of the classes in the Grid Package (<code><a href="https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs150/LabsEtc/FinalPP/Archaeology/grid.jar">grid.jar</a></code>), including<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>edu.kzoo.grid.TextCell</code> -- a class for  objects containing
    text that can be put in a grid.&nbsp; The current <code>ArchSimGridBlock</code> class
     extends <code>TextCell</code>.&nbsp; 
  </li><li><code>edu.kzoo.grid.GridObject</code> -- the more general class for objects
    that can be put in a grid.&nbsp; <code>TextCell</code> extends <code>GridObject</code>,
	as does the <code>ColorBlock</code> class you saw in the GridPlotter project.&nbsp; You
	may wish to change <code>ArchSimGridBlock</code> to extend <code>GridObject</code> or
	<code>ColorBlock</code> rather	than <code>TextCell</code> if you don't want to use text strings
	to	represent	artifacts&nbsp; and empty blocks.
  </li><li><code>edu.kzoo.grid.Location</code> - this class is
    exactly the same as the class you are used to from the Marine 
    Biology Simulation case study.</li>
    <li><code>edu.kzoo.grid.Grid</code> -- this class is a
    two-dimensional data structure you can use to simulate your
    simulation grid.  It has some methods that should be very useful
    for your implementation of the simulation.
